/* Rules */
// screen path names should be in all lower case except for main Tab Navigations. (Home, Setting, Sale, Products) it is already done.
// for example if you want to use "product list" as a screen name use like (product-list) without parenthesis.
// Allways try to wright neat codes with comments as much as possible! someone may be maintain it latter.
// You can Ignore this after you read it. Feel free to modify this file and even create from scratch, this is just template to work with the same flow.
